1.  What is the difference between traditional programming and Machine Learning?

    - [x] In traditional programming, a programmer has to formulate or code rules manually, whereas, in Machine Learning, the algorithm automatically formulates the rules from the data.
    - [ ] Machine learning identifies complex activities such as golf, while traditional programming is better suited to simpler activities such as walking.

2.  What do we call the process of telling the computer what the data represents (i.e. this data is for walking, this data is for running)?

    - [x] Labelling the Data
    - [ ] Programming the Data
    - [ ] Learning the Data
    - [ ] Categorizing the Data

3.  When I tell a computer what the data represents (i.e. this data is for walking, this data is for running), what is that process called?

    - [ ] Learning the Data
    - [ ] Programming the Data
    - [ ] Categorizing the Data
    - [x] Labeling the data

4.  What is a Dense layer?

    - [ ] A layer of disconnected neurons
    - [ ] A single neuron
    - [x] A layer of connected neurons
    - [ ] Mass over Volume

5.  How do you measure how good the current ‘guess’ is?

    - [x] Using the Loss function
    - [ ] Figuring out if you win or lose
    - [ ] Training a neural network

6.  What does the optimizer do?

    - [ ] Figures out how to efficiently compile your code
    - [ ] Measures how good the current guess is
    - [ ] Decides to stop training a neural network
    - [x] Generates a new and improved guess

7.  What is Convergence?

    - [ ] The bad guys in the next ‘Star Wars’ movie
    - [ ] A programming API for AI
    - [x] The process of getting very close to the correct answer
    - [ ] A dramatic increase in loss

8.  What does model.fit do?

    - [x] It trains the neural network to fit one set of values to another
    - [ ] It optimizes an existing model
    - [ ] It makes a model fit available memory
    - [ ] It determines if your activity is good for your body
